Understanding case definitions
This section aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of case definitions and their significance within the application. Let's explore each element in detail:
1.	Case Definitions Overview:
o	In WKS Platform, a case definition represents a blueprint or template for a specific type of case.
o	A case definition defines the structure, behavior, and lifecycle of a case within the system.
o	It serves as a reusable model that governs how cases of a particular type are created, managed, and processed.
2.	Key Concepts:
o	Case: A case refers to an instance of a specific case definition. It represents a real-life case or process that needs to be managed and monitored within the system.
o	Case Type: A case type categorizes cases based on their purpose, nature, or domain. Each case type is associated with a specific case definition.
o	Case Definition Key: Each case definition is uniquely identified by a case definition key, which is used to reference and manage cases of that type.
3.	Case Definition Elements:
o	WKS Platform case definitions consist of several essential elements that define the behavior and structure of cases. These elements may include:
	Case Name: The name of the case definition that helps identify and differentiate it from others.
	Case Description: A brief description of the case definition, providing additional context or information about its purpose.
	Case Variables: Variables are used to store and manage data associated with a case. They capture and hold information relevant to the case and can be accessed and modified throughout the case lifecycle.
	Case Milestones: Milestones represent significant points or achievements within a case. They mark important stages, events, or objectives that need to be reached or completed during the case's lifecycle.
	Case Activities: Activities represent the tasks, actions, or steps that need to be performed to progress a case. They define the sequence and dependencies of tasks within a case.
	Case Forms: Forms are used to capture and display data related to a case. They provide user-friendly interfaces for entering and editing information at different stages of the case.
	Case Rules: Rules define the decision-making logic within a case. They specify conditions and actions based on which the system can automatically evaluate and execute certain operations or make recommendations.
	Case Permissions: Permissions control the access and actions allowed on a case. They determine which users or roles can view, modify, or perform specific operations on a case.
4.	Case Definition Deployment:
o	Once a case definition is created, it needs to be deployed to the WKS Platform for it to be available for use.
o	Deployment involves making the case definition accessible to users and enabling the creation and management of cases based on that definition.
o	Only authorized users with appropriate permissions can deploy case definitions.
5.	Case Definition Versioning:
o	Case definitions can be versioned to manage changes and updates over time.
o	Versioning allows for the coexistence of multiple versions of a case definition, enabling backward compatibility and smooth transition between different versions.
o	It also facilitates auditing, tracking, and rollbacks if necessary.
6.	Case Definition Configuration:
o	WKS Platform provides a user-friendly interface or configuration file where you can define and configure case definitions.
o	This configuration process allows you to specify the elements mentioned earlier, such as case variables, milestones, activities, forms, rules, and permissions.
7.	Best Practices:
o	When designing case definitions, consider the specific requirements and characteristics of your organization's processes and cases.
o	Collaborate with key stakeholders and subject matter experts to define case structures, activities, and milestones that align with your business needs.
o	Regularly review and update case definitions to accommodate changes in processes or regulations.
o	Document and maintain a clear record of case definitions for reference and future enhancements.
