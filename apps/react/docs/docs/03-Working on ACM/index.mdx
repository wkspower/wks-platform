# Adaptive Case Management (ACM)

Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is a flexible approach to handling complex, unpredictable, and knowledge-driven workflows. Unlike traditional process automation, which relies on fixed sequences and predefined logic, ACM allows users to manage cases dynamically—adapting steps, responsibilities, and rules based on evolving contexts.

WKS supports ACM through a set of tools that empower business and technical users to coordinate human decision-making with automation in a scalable, auditable, and user-friendly environment.

## Key Benefits of ACM

### 1. Flexibility in Case Handling
ACM enables workflows that are non-linear and adaptable. This is essential when working with case types that involve frequent exceptions, variable requirements, or uncertain outcomes.

- Users can deviate from predefined paths when needed.
- Case steps can be created, modified, or reassigned during execution.

### 2. Decision-Making Empowerment
Knowledge workers can make case-level decisions without being constrained by rigid rules. WKS supports role-based access control (RBAC) and task delegation features to ensure decisions remain auditable and accountable.

---

### 3. Responsive and Context-Aware Workflows
ACM workflows can respond in real time to new data or user input. This allows for faster reaction to change and helps maintain alignment with operational or regulatory shifts.

- Support for conditional logic and dynamic form updates.
- Real-time notifications and SLA tracking.

---

### 4. Improved Customer Interaction
By allowing cases to evolve based on individual customer circumstances, ACM enables more accurate, personalised service delivery.

- Each case includes a full context history and decision trail.
- Customer-facing steps can be adapted to improve satisfaction.

---

### 5. Intelligent Resource Utilization
WKS's ACM model dynamically allocates tasks based on workload, priority, and case characteristics.

- Integration with queues, rules engines, and human-in-the-loop mechanisms.
- Enhanced workload visibility for operations managers.

---

### 6. Embedded Compliance and Risk Controls
Compliance is integrated into the workflow via dynamic policies and real-time audit capabilities.

- Custom policy enforcement rules.
- Built-in audit trail for every case activity and change.

---

### 7. Support for Continuous Improvement
Every completed case contributes to organisational learning. WKS supports capturing insights from case resolutions to refine future workflows.

- Historical data and metrics can be used for optimisation.
- Integration with analytics platforms for trend analysis.

---

### 8. Human-Automation Collaboration
ACM in WKS blends automated tasks and human decisions seamlessly. This approach maximises efficiency without losing critical judgement input.

- Human-in-the-loop steps are built into the workflow model.
- Users are prompted when input or decisions are required.

## Use Cases

ACM is particularly suitable for industries or departments that rely heavily on expert judgment and require adaptability, such as:

- Legal case review
- Insurance claims management
- Financial services and KYC processes
- Public sector citizen services
- Healthcare case coordination

## WKS and Adaptive Case Management

WKS is designed to support ACM through:

- A flexible workflow engine with dynamic state transitions.
- Low-code and no-code interfaces for custom logic and forms.
- Role-based access controls for secure decision-making.
- Native auditability and compliance tracking.
- Open-source architecture for extensibility and transparency.
