2.	Defining Basic Case Definition Information:
- On the case definition creation page, you will be prompted to provide basic information about the case definition.
- Enter a unique case definition key that will serve as the identifier for this case definition.
- Provide a descriptive name and optional description to help identify and differentiate the case definition.
3.	Configuring Case Variables:
- Identify the data elements or variables that need to be captured and managed within the case.
- Specify the name, data type, and other relevant attributes for each case variable.
- Define whether a variable is mandatory or optional for the case.
4.	Creating Case Milestones:
- Identify the significant milestones or stages that need to be achieved during the case lifecycle.
- Specify a name, description, and any associated deadlines or conditions for each milestone.
- Define the order and dependencies between milestones, if applicable.
5.	Designing Case Activities:

- Assign permissions for viewing, editing, completing, or performing specific operations on the case.
- Define the roles or users associated with each permission.
9.	Reviewing and Saving the Case Definition:
- Review all the configured elements of the case definition.
- Validate that the information provided is accurate and meets your requirements.
- Once satisfied, save the case definition to make it available for use in WKS Platform.
