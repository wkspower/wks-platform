---

This section provides a comprehensive overview of **case definitions** in the WKS Platform and explains their role in case management.

---

## Overview

In the **WKS Platform**, a *case definition* acts as a reusable template for a specific type of case. It defines the **structure**, **behaviour**, and **lifecycle** of a case and governs how similar cases are created, processed, and monitored.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Case**: An individual instance created from a case definition. It represents a real-world scenario or process that needs management.
- **Case Type**: Categorises cases by domain or function. Each type is linked to a specific case definition.
- **Case Definition Key**: A unique identifier for each case definition, used to reference and manage cases programmatically.

---

## Case Definition Elements

A case definition in WKS comprises several elements that define its functionality and data model:

| Element              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case Name**        | A user-friendly name for identifying the case definition.                  |
| **Case Description** | A short explanation of the case's purpose and context.                     |
| **Case Variables**   | Store and manage case-specific data throughout its lifecycle.              |
| **Case Milestones**  | Represent key events or objectives in the case process.                    |
| **Case Activities**  | Define the tasks or actions required to complete the case.                 |
| **Case Forms**       | User interfaces for capturing or displaying case data.                     |
| **Case Rules**       | Logic that drives decision-making based on conditions and actions.         |
| **Case Permissions** | Specify who can access, view, or modify the case.                          |

## Case Definition Deployment

To make a case definition available for use, it must be **deployed** to the WKS Platform:

- Deployment enables case creation and management based on the definition.
- Only users with the appropriate permissions can deploy definitions.

---

## Versioning

Case definitions support **versioning** to manage change over time:

- Multiple versions can coexist for backward compatibility.
- Versioning allows for:
  - Smooth transitions between process updates
  - Change tracking and auditing
  - Rollbacks if needed

---

## Configuration

Case definitions can be created and managed using either:

- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** provided by WKS
- A **configuration file**, typically in JSON or YAML format

Configuration includes defining elements such as:

- Variables  
- Milestones  
- Activities  
- Forms  
- Rules  
- Permissions

---

## Best Practices

To design effective and maintainable case definitions:

- Align definitions with organizational processes and objectives.
- Involve stakeholders and domain experts during design.
- Review and update definitions regularly to reflect process or policy changes.
- Maintain clear, versioned documentation for each case definition.

## 📁 Case Definition

Case definitions are the backbone of how cases operate within WKS. They define the structure, transitions, logic, and routing of tasks throughout the case lifecycle.

### Why It Matters

Understanding case definitions is essential for implementing consistent, automated, and traceable workflows. By configuring **Stages**, **Event Listeners**, and **Queues**, organizations can design flexible cases that respond dynamically to user input, system events, or external data sources.

---

### 🔄 Stages

**Stages** represent logical segments in a case lifecycle. Each stage can contain a set of tasks, rules, and forms, and can be configured to operate sequentially or in parallel.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Transitions:** Define the flow between stages using rules or triggers.
- **Conditions:** Control when and how a stage becomes active or is skipped.
- **Parallelism:** Enable stages to run simultaneously for efficiency and flexibility.

Stages allow the case to evolve contextually—adapting based on inputs, external data, or user behavior.

---

### 📣 Event Listeners

**Event listeners** are mechanisms that react to specific triggers during the case lifecycle. These can be:

- **System events** (e.g., case created, task completed)
- **Custom-defined events** (e.g., external API callbacks, integration responses)

**Use Cases:**
- Automate transitions when certain conditions are met
- Launch external services or workflows in reaction to internal events
- Notify users or teams when events of interest occur

Event listeners help decouple logic from the case’s main flow, improving maintainability and scalability.

---

### 🗃️ Queues

**Queues** define how tasks within a case are assigned and routed. WKS supports both static and dynamic assignment strategies.

**Configuration Options:**
- Assign tasks based on role, group, or user metadata
- Use routing logic to assign tasks to the most appropriate user
- Integrate with external systems to enforce service-level objectives (SLOs)

Queues ensure efficient load distribution and proper accountability across case workers.

---

## 📁 Case Instance

A **Case Instance** is a running instance of a case definition. Once initiated, it holds all operational data, user interactions, and audit trails related to that specific execution.

### Why It Matters

Case instances are the primary way users and systems interact with active workflows. This documentation area focuses on the features available during runtime that enhance usability, visibility, collaboration, and traceability.

---

### 🧾 Case Details

Users can view and update case metadata, including:
- Title, type, and category
- Custom variables and properties
- Case owner and participants

Support for versioned updates and change logs ensures traceability.

---

### ✅ Tasks

Case instances often include tasks that are:
- **Automated (via processes)** or
- **Manual (performed by users)**

This section explains:
- Task creation and linkage
- Task assignment and reassignment
- Task completion workflows
- Working with tasks from the user’s perspective

---

### 💬 Comments

Collaborative case discussions can be handled through inline comments:
- Add, edit, and delete comments
- Mention users
- Tag timestamps or attach context

This section includes:
- How to manage comments

---

### 📎 Documents

Cases often include document uploads such as contracts, forms, and evidential attachments.

This section covers:
- Document upload and metadata configuration
- Version control and history
- Access control and sharing settings
- Tagging and classification best practices

---

### 📧 Emails

WKS supports email interactions tied directly to cases:
- Automatically log inbound emails
- Send templated outbound messages
- View full communication history from within the case
- Enable event-triggered email notifications

Useful for service desks, HR processes, or compliance cases where communication is critical.

---

### ✳️ Creating Case Instances

Case instances can be created:
- **Manually** via the user interface
- **Automatically** via process events or API integrations

This section outlines:
- Required fields and configuration steps
- Automated creation logic using external triggers
- Best practices for case initialization

---

### 🕵️ Audit & History

For each case instance, WKS maintains a complete audit trail, including:
- Stage and status changes
- Task events (assignments, completions)
- Form submissions and updates
- User interactions and system-triggered events

Audit logs are accessible for compliance, quality control, and internal reviews.
