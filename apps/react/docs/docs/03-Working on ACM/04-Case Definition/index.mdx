title: Case Definition
---

This section provides a comprehensive overview of **case definitions** in the WKS Platform and explains their role in case management.

---

## Overview

In the **WKS Platform**, a *case definition* acts as a reusable template for a specific type of case. It defines the **structure**, **behaviour**, and **lifecycle** of a case and governs how similar cases are created, processed, and monitored.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Case**: An individual instance created from a case definition. It represents a real-world scenario or process that needs management.
- **Case Type**: Categorises cases by domain or function. Each type is linked to a specific case definition.
- **Case Definition Key**: A unique identifier for each case definition, used to reference and manage cases programmatically.

## Case Definition Elements

A case definition in WKS comprises several elements that define its functionality and data model:

| Element              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case Name**        | A user-friendly name for identifying the case definition.                  |
| **Case Description** | A short explanation of the case's purpose and context.                     |
| **Case Variables**   | Store and manage case-specific data throughout its lifecycle.              |
| **Case Milestones**  | Represent key events or objectives in the case process.                    |
| **Case Activities**  | Define the tasks or actions required to complete the case.                 |
| **Case Forms**       | User interfaces for capturing or displaying case data.                     |
| **Case Rules**       | Logic that drives decision-making based on conditions and actions.         |
| **Case Permissions** | Specify who can access, view, or modify the case.                          |

## Case Definition Deployment

To make a case definition available for use, it must be **deployed** to the WKS Platform:

- Deployment enables case creation and management based on the definition.
- Only users with the appropriate permissions can deploy definitions.

---

## Versioning

Case definitions support **versioning** to manage change over time:

- Multiple versions can coexist for backward compatibility.
- Versioning allows for:
  - Smooth transitions between process updates
  - Change tracking and auditing
  - Rollbacks if needed

---

## Configuration

Case definitions can be created and managed using either:

- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** provided by WKS
- A **configuration file**, typically in JSON or YAML format

Configuration includes defining elements such as:

- Variables  
- Milestones  
- Activities  
- Forms  
- Rules  
- Permissions

## Best Practices

To design effective and maintainable case definitions:

- Align definitions with organizational processes and objectives.
- Involve stakeholders and domain experts during design.
- Review and update definitions regularly to reflect process or policy changes.
- Maintain clear, versioned documentation for each case definition.
