# Forms in the WKS Platform

Forms in the WKS Platform are essential user interface components designed to collect and input structured data. They enable users to interact with processes efficiently, support data-driven decisions, and streamline workflow execution across the platform.

## Key Features of WKS Forms

### 1. Data Input
Forms support the entry of various data types including:
- Text
- Numbers

This functionality ensures that all relevant task or process data is captured accurately.

### 2. Customisation
Forms are highly customizable:
- Define input field types (e.g., dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons)
- Adjust layout and styling to match process needs
- Apply validation rules to maintain data integrity

### 3. Dynamic Fields
Dynamic behaviour allows fields to:

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures:
- Only authorised users can view or edit specific forms
- Sensitive data remains secure and compliant with policies

### 7. Workflow Integration
Forms function as interactive steps within workflows, allowing:
- Task-specific data capture
- Guided user interactions through predefined process stages
