# Understanding Process Instances in WKS

A **process instance** represents a single execution of a business process within the WKS Platform. It is created when a process is triggered and contains all the data, context, and state relevant to that specific run. Each process instance follows the logic defined in a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram.

## 🔍 What Is a Process Instance?

In simple terms, a process instance is a "live" or historical execution of a workflow. For every time a process is started, whether automatically or manually, a new, uniquely identifiable process instance is created to track its execution from start to finish.

## 📌 Key Characteristics

| Attribute           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unique ID**        | Each instance has a unique **Process Instance ID** to distinguish it from others. |
| **Execution Context**| Stores all relevant variables, data inputs, and outputs needed during the execution. |
| **Lifecycle**        | Follows stages from initiation to completion (or termination), progressing through tasks, events, and gateways. |
| **State**            | Indicates current status—such as `active`, `suspended`, `completed`, or `terminated`. |
| **Audit Trail**      | Captures a detailed execution log, enabling full traceability of actions and decisions. |
