# BPMN and DMN Modeler

The **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** and **DMN (Decision Model and Notation)** Modeler are powerful tools integrated into the **WKS Platform**. They enable the visual design and modeling of business processes and decision rules using standardised graphical representations that enhance communication, analysis, and automation.

## BPMN Modeler

BPMN is a standard for modelling business processes, representing the sequence of activities, events, gateways, and flows that define how processes are executed.

The BPMN Modeler in the WKS Platform allows users to:

- **Model Process Flows**  
  Design flows using standard BPMN elements such as tasks, gateways, events, and connectors to accurately depict the sequence and logic of a process.

- **Capture Process Details**  
  Define inputs, outputs, roles, decision points, and performance metrics directly within the BPMN diagrams to provide a complete view of the process.

- **Analyse and Optimize**  
  Identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities by analysing BPMN diagrams, leading to enhanced process performance.

- **Execute Processes**  
  Use BPMN diagrams as blueprints for implementation. Assign tasks, monitor progress, and ensure efficient execution across the organzation.

## DMN Modeler

DMN is a standard for modelling decision logic, capturing the rules and conditions that guide organizational decision-making.

The DMN Modeler in the WKS Platform allows users to:

- **Model Decision Tables**  
  Create decision tables using DMN elements such as input data, decision logic, and output results, visually structuring decision-making rules.

- **Capture Decision Logic**  
  Define logic using expressions, constraints, and rule sets within DMN diagrams, specifying how decisions are derived based on given inputs.

- **Analyse and Optimise**  
  Review DMN diagrams to ensure decision models are complete, consistent, and accurate, optimizing decision quality and reliability.

- **Execute Decisions**  
  Integrate decision tables with BPMN processes to automate decision-making dynamically during process execution.

## Benefits of the BPMN & DMN Modeler

- **Standardization**  
  Utilises BPMN and DMN standards to ensure clarity, uniformity, and precision across process and decision models.

- **Visualisation**  
  Provides intuitive visual representations, making complex processes and decisions easier to understand, communicate, and maintain.

- **Automation**  
  Supports process and decision automation by offering structured, executable models within the WKS Platform.

- **Integration**  
  Seamlessly connects with other WKS Platform features, enabling the design, execution, and optimization of complete business workflows and decisions.
