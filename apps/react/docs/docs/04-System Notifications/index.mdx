## Introducing [Novu](https://novu.co/) Integration into WKS Platform

### Streamlining Communication Channels

This demonstration showcases the integration of [Novu](https://novu.co/) into the WKS Platform, aimed at simplifying and streamlining communication channels for developers.

WKS Platform, built on the Camunda workflow automation engine, offers adaptive case management capabilities for handling complex processes efficiently.

[Novu](https://novu.co/), an open-source notification infrastructure, provides simple components and APIs to manage various communication channels such as email, SMS, direct messaging, in-app notifications, and push notifications in one centralized platform.

## Overview

The new notifications system addresses a long-standing user need: ensuring case workers and stakeholders receive timely updates on case-related events, while minimizing disruption to their workflow. Instead of embedding notification logic within BPMN processes, WKS delegates this responsibility to a scalable, dedicated notification infrastructure powered by **Kafka** and **Novu**.

---

## What is possible through this tool

Process participants, such as case workers, will be able to stay informed about relevant events, including:

- New case creation
- Comments added to a case
- Tasks created, assigned, or completed
- Documents uploaded
- Case status or stage updates

Embedding notifications directly into BPMN flows often results in unnecessary process complexity. By decoupling this concern, the WKS approach enables scalability and clarity.

## How it works:
1. **WKS Platform** emits system events.
2. **Kafka** acts as an event hub, capturing and routing messages.
3. **Novu** delivers messages to configured channels based on workflows.

> **Note:** Kafka and Novu are optional. Ask our team about the possibility to replace them with other event brokers or notification services.

---

## 📡 Supported Notification Channels

- 📧 Email  
- 💬 In-App (Web and Mobile)  
- 📱 SMS  
- 🧵 Slack  
- 👥 Microsoft Teams

These channels are managed through **Novu workflows**, allowing flexible mapping of events to delivery preferences.

---

## 🧩 Example Use Cases

Once system notifications are enabled, a notification icon appears in the WKS UI. Users therefore can:

- View real-time updates on cases and tasks
- Monitor specific events such as new case creation or task assignment
- (Coming soon) Configure personal notification preferences by event type and delivery channel

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The WKS notification system offers real-time, multi-channel alerts while keeping your BPMN workflows streamlined and maintainable. Built with Kafka and Novu, it's both scalable and flexible—empowering teams to stay informed without adding process bloat.
