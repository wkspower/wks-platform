## Introducing [Novu](https://novu.co/) Integration into WKS Platform

### Streamlining Communication Channels

This demonstration showcases the integration of [Novu](https://novu.co/) into the WKS Platform, aimed at simplifying and streamlining communication channels for developers.

WKS Platform, built on the Camunda workflow automation engine, offers adaptive case management capabilities for handling complex processes efficiently.

[Novu](https://novu.co/), an open-source notification infrastructure, provides simple components and APIs to manage various communication channels such as email, SMS, direct messaging, in-app notifications, and push notifications in one centralized platform.

# System Notifications in the WKS Platform

The WKS platform now includes a powerful **system notifications feature**, designed to improve user experience and streamline process communication without cluttering core BPM workflows.

## Overview

The new notifications system addresses a long-standing user need: ensuring case workers and stakeholders receive timely updates on case-related events, while minimizing disruption to their workflow. Instead of embedding notification logic within BPMN processes, WKS delegates this responsibility to a scalable, dedicated notification infrastructure powered by **Kafka** and **Novu**.

---

## Why Notifications Matter

Process participants, such as case workers, need to stay informed about relevant events, including:

- New case creation
- Comments added to a case
- Tasks created, assigned, or completed
- Documents uploaded
- Case status or stage updates

Embedding notifications directly into BPMN flows often results in unnecessary process complexity. By decoupling this concern, the WKS approach enables scalability and clarity.

---

## Key Requirements Addressed

- ✅ Notify users of key events without interrupting their workflow
- ✅ Maintain process clarity and separation of concerns
- ✅ Support for **asynchronous** and **scalable** event processing
- ✅ Integration with multiple channels: Email, SMS, Slack, Microsoft Teams, In-App, and more
