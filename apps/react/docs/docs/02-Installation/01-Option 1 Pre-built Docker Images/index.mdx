# WKS Platform Installation Guide

## Option 1: Running with Pre-built Docker Images

> **⚠️ Warning:** The provided Docker Compose files are recommended **only for development or test environments**.

This guide outlines the steps to quickly set up and run the WKS Platform using pre-built Docker images. This approach provides a seamless and consistent environment with all necessary dependencies and services pre-configured.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

* Docker installed on your system
* Git installed for cloning the repository

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone the Docker Configuration Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wkspower/wks-platform-docker.git
cd wks-platform-docker
```

### 2. Run Docker Compose

Choose one of the following options depending on the version of Camunda you want to use:

#### For Camunda 7

```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yaml \
  -f docker-compose.camunda7.yaml \
  -f docker-compose.demo-data-loader.camunda7.yaml \
  -f docker-compose.portal.yaml \
  up -d --build
```

#### For Camunda 8

```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yaml \
  -f docker-compose.camunda8.yaml \
  -f docker-compose.demo-data-loader.camunda8.yaml \
  -f docker-compose.portal.yaml \
  up -d --build
```

### 3. Configure Hostnames

Add the following lines to your local `hosts` file to ensure proper routing of portal requests:

```
127.0.0.1 minio
::1       minio
```

## 🌐 Accessing the Web Applications

Once all containers have started, you can access the following web applications:

### WKS Platform Portal

* **URL:** [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
* **Username:** `demo`
* **Password:** `demo`

### Camunda (7 or 8)

* **URL:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* **Username:** `demo`
* **Password:** `demo`

### Keycloak

* **URL:** [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `admin`

### MinIO

* **URL:** [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
* **Username:** `minio`
* **Password:** `#minio00#`

> **Note:** It may take some time for the applications to become fully operational during the first run. If you encounter issues, wait a few moments and try again.

## 🛠️ Additional Details

* The **MongoDB** database used by the applications is accessible on port `27017`.
* Ensure all services are running by checking container statuses with:

```bash
docker ps
```
