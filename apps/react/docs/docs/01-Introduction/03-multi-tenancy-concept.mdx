# Multi-Tenancy in the WKS Platform

## Overview

The WKS Platform supports **multi-tenancy** to provide each client (tenant) with a secure, isolated environment, comparable to giving each tenant their own private suite in a shared office building. This architecture enables service providers to efficiently manage multiple clients while ensuring data separation, operational security, and configurability.

## Architecture

WKS implements multi-tenancy through three core components:

- **Tenant-specific subdomains** for environment separation
- **Keycloak realms** for isolated authentication and authorization
- **MongoDB databases** for secure, per-tenant data storage

---

### 1. Tenant Subdomain Structure

Each tenant is assigned a unique subdomain as their entry point to the platform:

- **Format:** `tenant_id.somedomain.com`
- **Example:** `saasCustomer1.wksplatform.com`

This structure provides:

- A dedicated namespace for each tenant
- Easy DNS-level isolation
- Clear, secure routing of tenant-specific traffic

---

### 2. Keycloak Realms for Identity Management

Each tenant operates within its own [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) realm:

- **Realm Isolation:** Each realm provides a completely independent identity domain
- **Local Credential Management:** Users, roles, groups, and permissions are managed within the tenant’s realm
- **Security Benefits:** No credential overlap or access leakage between tenants

**Tenant Onboarding Workflow:**

1. A new Keycloak realm is automatically provisioned
2. Tenant-specific identity configurations are applied
3. Role-based access control (RBAC) is set according to client requirements

---

### 3. MongoDB for Data Isolation

WKS allocates a dedicated MongoDB database for each tenant:

- **Data Isolation:** Ensures strict separation of all tenant records
- **Security:** No cross-tenant visibility or access
- **Scalability:** Databases can scale independently based on tenant activity and data volume

**Database Lifecycle:**

- Created automatically during tenant onboarding
- Tied directly to the tenant’s subdomain and Keycloak realm
- Managed independently for backups, performance tuning, and maintenance

## Benefits of WKS Multi-Tenancy

- 🔐 **Security:** Full isolation of identity and data
- ⚙️ **Customization:** Each tenant can define their own workflows, roles, and integrations
- 🚀 **Scalability:** Infrastructure supports growth across multiple tenants without conflict
- 🧩 **Flexibility:** Tenants operate independently while benefiting from shared platform resources
