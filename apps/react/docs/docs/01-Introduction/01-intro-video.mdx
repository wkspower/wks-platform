## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔁 Processes  
Processes in WKS are BPMN-based automated workflows that can span multiple steps, systems, and stakeholders. These are created using visual designers and executed as process instances.

### 📦 Use Cases  
Use cases represent real-world scenarios automated within the platform, from government case management and invoice approvals to HR onboarding and IT service requests.

### ✅ Tasks  
Tasks are the atomic units of work in a process or case. WKS supports process tasks, case tasks, and ad hoc tasks, each with rich assignment logic, SLA tracking, and interface flexibility.

### 📝 Forms  
WKS includes a form designer that allows users to build dynamic, user-friendly interfaces for data collection, approvals, and interaction with automated workflows, without writing code.

### 🔍 Audits & Compliance  
Audit trails are generated automatically to record all user actions and process transitions, aiding compliance, security, and internal governance.

### 🧩 No-Code & Low-Code Capabilities  
- **No-code:** For business users who want to build and deploy workflows using visual tools.  
- **Low-code:** For developers who want to extend workflows with scripts, service connectors, and APIs.

### 🌱 Open Source Foundations  
WKS is built on a modular open-source stack (including Camunda, Kafka, and others), giving organizations flexibility, transparency, and the ability to avoid vendor lock-in.
