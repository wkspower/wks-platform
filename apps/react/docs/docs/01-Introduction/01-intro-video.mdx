# WKS Platform: Product Demo Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the WKS Platform product demo. This document serves as a reference for the key features and concepts of the WKS Platform, an open-source case management framework seamlessly integrated with Camunda BPM.

## What Is the WKS Platform?

WKS (Workflow Knowledge System) is an adaptive case management platform built to streamline complex, knowledge-driven processes. Designed for flexibility, it blends structured BPM elements with the dynamic nature of case management. It is open-source under the MIT licence.

### Core Concept: Case Definition

A Case Definition is the backbone of any WKS implementation. It outlines the structural blueprint of a case, containing elements such as:

1. Stages – Lifecycle milestones a case passes through
2. Forms – UI components capturing case-related data
3. Processes – BPMN-defined process workflows
4. Tasks – User or system tasks to be completed
5. Event Listeners – Triggers based on system or user events

From a case definition, users or systems can generate Case Instances that follow the defined structure and flow.

## Key Platform Features

###  Stages

Stages define the milestones in a case’s lifecycle. As users complete tasks or processes, the case progresses through these predefined stages.

### Forms

Forms are built using Form.io, an open-source form builder. The interface allows for drag-and-drop components, validations, and conditional logic, making forms highly customisable and reusable.

### BPMN Processes

Using a web-based modeler (integrated with Camunda), users can design process diagrams that control logic within stages. Processes can be triggered automatically or manually at different case stages.

### Event Listeners

These define how the system reacts to case-related events:

- Task completions
- Stage updates
- Case data changes

Listeners can trigger actions such as stage transitions.

### Access Control

Future roadmap features include more granular access controls:

- Role-based process visibility

- Stage-based process initiation rights

### Integration with MinIO

Documents uploaded to a case instance are stored in MinIO, a high-performance object storage system. Users can preview files directly from the interface.

### Communication

Users can send and receive emails within case instances, centralising all communication related to a case. This helps reduce reliance on fragmented email threads.
